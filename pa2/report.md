# CSE 6220 Programming Assignment 2 Report

## Team members

Jiashu Li, Yusen Su, Zixuan Wang

## Space and run-time analysis of our implementation (4 pts)

### Arbitrary permutation

$O()$

### Hypecubic permutation

### Matrix transpose

## Evaluate the performance with varying input matrix sizes

(Fixing the number of processors to 8 and 16, plot the runtimes of the three approaches over different matrix sizes and describe your observations of the results. 2 plots, 8 pts)

### $p = 8$

? problem size: 

### $p = 16$

? problem size: 

### Empirical analysis, observations, and conclusion (8 pts)

(Try to come up with some important observations on your program. We are not asking that specific questions be answered but you are expected to think on your own, experiment and show the conclusions along with the evidence that led you to reach the conclusions. Any irregular or unexpected results should also be noted and explained why it is unavoidable)
